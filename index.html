				<h2>Plots and Results for my Thesis</h2>
				<p> On this page I am displaying and discussing some of the key results in visualizations! </p>
				<p> Phishing scams are a billion-dollar problem. According to Threatpost, in 2020, business email compromise phishing attacks cost the US economy $ 1.8 billion. Social media phishing scams are also on the rise with 74% of companies experiencing social media attacks in 2021 according to Proofpoint. Educating users about phishing scams is an effective strategy for reducing phishing attacks. Despite efforts to combat phishing, the number of attacks continues to rise, likely indicative of a reticence of users to change online behaviors. Existing research into predicting vulnerable social media users that are susceptible to phishing mostly focuses on content analysis of their posts or the users they interact with, and not their behaviors. In contrast, in this research, we study the online behaviors of social media users on Twitter to identify those that are susceptible to phishing attacks. Specifically, we analyzed the behaviors of social media users that succumb to phishing scams in comparison to a control group of users that did not, to identify behavioral patterns that distinguish them. Online actions encompass aspects such as liking and sharing habits, the nature of posts, duration of engagement in posting activities, among others.</p>

				<h3> Overview of the Data </h3>
				<p> Our dataset of susceptible users was provided by authors studying both political and financial social media manipulation. In the next two sections we describe these datasets and the respective control datasets we generated. We then collected 11 control posts and the users who interacted with them. </p>
				
				<p><img src="images/img01.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="200" class="alignleft" /> These two scatter plots represent the age vs. log of the number of followers for the political and financial datasets. At first glance, the scatter plots, as seen in these plots, do not show a significant difference between the susceptible and control groups. However, looking more closely at the scatter plots for log followers versus age, we can see there are a few susceptible users with lower numbers of log followers and age than the control group. We also see a potential cluster of control users with a higher number of log followers and older accounts. The control observation is more significant in the plot for the political dataset and the susceptible observation is more significant in the financial dataset plot. </p>
