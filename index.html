  <h2>Interacting with Data: Voting Trends and Turnouts<br></h2>
  
  <h3>Part 1 Plot<br></h3>
  
  <h3>In this visualization we can notice those with higher income tend to vote sporadically and always more then those with lower incomes. However, it appears that those within the $75K-125K income range are more likely to always and sporadically vote than those who make over $125K. The yellow and red blocks look bigger in comparison across these two income ranges. bigger  It also looks like those with a higher level of education are more likely to always vote. Once again, we can see this by comparing the size of the blocks. It is also notable the rarely/never blue block is more noticeably larger for the less than $40k income and the high school education or less. For the top two income ranges and the some college and college education levels the rarely/never vote blocks are more similar in size. <br></h3>
