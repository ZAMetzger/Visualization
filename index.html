  <body>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;In this visualization we can notice those with higher income tend to vote sporadically and always more then those with lower incomes. However, it appears that those within the $75K-125K income range are more likely to always and sporadically vote than those who make over $125K. The yellow and red blocks look bigger in comparison across these two income ranges. bigger  It also looks like those with a higher level of education are more likely to always vote. Once again, we can see this by comparing the size of the blocks. It is also notable the rarely/never blue block is more noticeably larger for the less than $40k income and the high school education or less. For the top two income ranges and the some college and college education levels the rarely/never vote blocks are more similar in size. <br></body>

  <body><p><span='tab'>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;In this visualization we can see how the percent voter turnout and percent of absentee ballots have changed overtime. The year 2020 stands our as an outlier in these plots. The percent turnout is on the higher side and the percent absentee is drastically higher. This was due to the COVID pandemic. Most people wanted to avoid public spaces, so they wouldnâ€™t be spreading or getting the virus. In 2016 and 2020 we see a higher average percent turnout than the congressional years. However, the 2016 and 2018 percent turnouts look similar. The percent turnout for 2016 still appears to be higher on average, but the 2018 election had higher average percent turnout than the other congressional election years, 2014 and 2022.</span><p><br></body>

  <body>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;This Visualization represents percent of voter turnout across different counties in Virginia. It appears as if those in the north and along the coast appear to turnout to vote at higher rates. The west has the lowest rates of voter turnout.  Rappahanock and Goochland Counties appear to have the highest voter turnout. Petersburg City and Buchanan County appear to have the lowest voter turnout. <br></body>


  <h3>How did I make this better?<br></h3>
  <body>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; One of the main changes I made was to the subtitles. I changed the color to be a lighter grey so there would be better sepperation between the different headings. I felt as if the original documentation and style was good for the purpose of displaying the plots in a clear and non distracting way. One problem I ran into was the text was not showing up under the plots. It was showing up next to it, so I had to add an aditional break. I also attempted to add a tab function, but I found out I could just use a built in html feature instead. <br></body>
